DO NOT PUT A _polymod_meta.json FILE IN CHARACTERS!!!!!!

Custom characters act the way that they are in the first version of modding plus, with a few tweaks.
- animation is now named animations (animation with an extra s)
- offset is now named animations_offsets
- clone field to clone an existing character (only supports bf, pico and dad, YOU CANT CHANGE OFFSETS WHEN CLONED)
